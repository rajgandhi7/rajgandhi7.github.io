Hello, I am Raj, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Mathematics at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, under the joint supervision of Professor Alexander Oron and Professor Alexander Nepomnyashchy.  I expect to submit my Ph.D. dissertation on the Instabilities in nanofluid layers by February 2026. 

My research interests include theoretical and numerical investigation of the interdisciplinary problems in fluid mechanics, interfacial instabilities, thin film hydrodynamics, nonlinear stability, and hydrodynamic stability in complex liquids. 

I am always excited to collaborate on some of the unsolved problems in fluid mechanics.


Put your address / P.O. box / other inf right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
