Hello, I am Raj, a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Mathematics at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, under the joint supervision of Professor Alexander Oron and Professor Alexander Nepomnyashchy.  I expect to submit my Ph.D. dissertation on the Instabilities in nanofluid layers by February 2026. 

My research interests include theoretical and numerical investigation of the interdisciplinary problems in fluid mechanics, interfacial instabilities, thin film hydrodynamics, nonlinear stability, and hydrodynamic stability in complex liquids. 

I am always excited to collaborate on some of the unsolved problems in fluid mechanics.
